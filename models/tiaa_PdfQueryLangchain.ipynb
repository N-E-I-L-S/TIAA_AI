These new government schemes are available to everyone who wants to \\nparticipate, regardless of gender, marital status, socioeconomic status, location, et c. However, \\nit is up to the residents to analyze several plans and select the one that best meets their \\nrequirements to maximize their income flow.  \\nInvesting in new government schemes provides the most significant benefit of being free of \\nrisk and easy. Post offices and banks all around India make it possible for anyone interested \\nin signing up for any government program they want.  Government  investment  \\nschemes  typically result in tax breaks for the government and the investor. Investors would \\nbe well to compare the various strategies before deciding on the one that promises the highest \\nreturn.  \\nWhat are Government Investment Schemes?  \\nIndia's government and various public sector financial organizations have introduced \\nSchemes as investment opportunities for Indian citizens. These plans were implemented to \\nencourage responsible economic behavior among Indian citizens. Historically, India ns had a \\nhabit of hoarding their wealth, which led to low economic growth and stagnation.

Certain administrative authorities have drawn attention to the fact that in cases of retirement on superannuation the work of assessment of the demands outstanding against them commences two years in advance whereas in other cases of retirement assessment of Govt. dues etc. can begin only after the retirement has been approved by Govt. and have raised a doubt where the provisions of Rule 68 are also applicable to those who retired otherwise on superannuation and if so whether the time limit of 3 months is to be observed in such cases. The position has been reviewed in consultation with the Ministry of Finance. It has been decided that if the payment of gratuity has been delayed due to administrative lapses for no fault of the retiring employee in cases of retirement other than superannuation, the payment of interest may be regulated in the following matter:-\\n\\n(i) In case of Government servants against whom disciplinary / judicial proceedings are pending on the date of retirement and in which gratuity is withheld till the conclusion of the proceedings :-\\n\\n(a) In such cases if the government servant is exonerated of all charges and where the gratuity is paid on the conclusion of such proceedings, the payment of gratuity will be deemed to have fallen due on the date following the date of retirement vide DPAR’s OM No. 1(4)/Pen.Unit/82 dated 10.01.83. If the payment of gratuity has been authorised after 3 months from the date of his retirement interest may be allowed beyond the period of 3 months from the date of retirement.\\n\\n(b) In cases where the disciplinary / judicial proceedings are dropped on account of the death of the Government servant during the pendency of disciplinary / judicial proceedings, the payment of gratuity will be deemed to have fallen due on the date following the date of death and if the payment of gratuity has been delayed interest may be allowed for the period of delay beyond 3 months from the date of death.\\n\\nPg-42\\n\\nBack\\n\\n(c) In cases where the Government servant is not fully exonerated on the conclusion of disciplinary / judicial proceedings and where the competent authority decides to allow payment of gratuity, in such cases, the payment of gratuity will be deemed to have fallen due on the date of issue of orders by the competent authority for payment of gratuity vide DPAR’s OM No. 7 (1). PU / 79 dated 11.7.1979. If thepayment of gratuity is delayed in such cases interest will be payable for the period of delay beyond 3 months from the date of issue of the above mention orders by the competent authority.\\n\\n(ii) On retirement other than on superannuation:-\\n\\nSuch cases of retirement will be either under clause (j) or clause (k) of FR 56 or Rules, 38, 39, 40, 48 or 48- A of the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972. In such cases the pension sanctioning authority does not get adequate time for processing pension papers, as is available to it in the case of retirement on superannuation. Instructions have already been issued from time to time that the work relating to verification of service should be done on year to year basis and should not be kept in arrears. Provisions also exists that on completion of 25 years qualifying service or on one being left with 5 years service before the date of retirement,whichever is earlier, the head of office should verify the service rendered by such Government servant and communicate to him the period of qualifying service as determined vide Rule 32 of the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972. It is, therefore, expected that even in cases of retirement other than on superannuation it should not take unduly long time for all Heads of Offices to prepare pension papers of retiring employees. It has therefore being decided that where the payment of gratuity in such cases is delayed beyond 6 months from the date of retirement, interest should be paid for the period of delay beyond 6 months from the date of retirement.\\n\\n(iii) On death of the Government servant while in service:-\\n\\nSuch cases may be considered on the same lines as mentioned in clause (ii) above. Detailed procedure for processing the payment of death gratuity is explained in Rule 77to 80 of the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972. It is felt that in these cases also it should be possible for the respective offices to process the payment of death gratuity within a reasonable time. It has, therefore, being decide that where the payment of death gratuity is delayed beyond 6 months from the date of death, interest should be paid for the period of delay beyond 6 months from the date of death. If in any case the payment of death gratuity is held up on account of more than one claimant staking his / her claim to the same, such cases will not automatically qualify for payment of interest in terms of these orders. These will be examined separately in consultation with this Department on the merits of each.\\n\\n(iv) Cases where the amount of gratuity already paid is enhanced on account of revision on emoluments or liberalisation in the provisions relating to gratuity from a date prior to the date of retirement of the government servant concerned :-\\n\\nPg-43\\n\\nBack\\n\\nAt present, no interest is paid in such cases. Representations have been received that the payment of difference in gratuity in such cases is unduly delayed. It is expected that once the orders relating to revision of emoluments reckoning for gratuity or liberalisation of rules relating to entitlement paid within a reasonable time. Taking into account all aspects, it has now been decided that if the payment on account of arrears of gratuity is delayed beyond a period of 3 months from the date of issue of the orders revising the emoluments liberalisation in the rules interest may be allowed for the delay beyond the period of 3 months of the date of issue of the said orders.\\n\\n(V) In cases of permanent absorption in PSU/autonomous bodies otherwise than on enmass transfer on conversion of government department or a part thereof into PSU/autonomous body :-\\n\\nPayment of interest on delayed payment of gratuity in these cases may also be decided in the same manner as prescribed in clauses (ii) above. If the payment of gratuity has been delayed beyond 6 months from the date of permanent absorption the interest may be allowed for the period of delay beyond 6 months.\\n\\n3. As far as retirement on superannuation is concerned, the existing procedure for grant of interest if the payment of gratuity is delayed due to administrative reasons /lapses for no fault of the retiring employee will continue to be applicable. In other words, interest will be allowed for the period of delay beyond 3 months from the date of retirement.\\n\\n4. It has also been observed that there is a general impression among the administrative authorities that interest is to be paid only after disciplinary action being taken against the defaulting staff found responsible for the delay in payment of gratuity is concluded. It is hereby clarified that this impression is not correct. In all cases in which it is established that the delay in payment of gratuity was attributable to administrative lapses and for no fault of the retiring employee concerned, the interest should be paid without waiting for the outcome of the disciplinary proceedings against the defaulting staff. The disciplinary cases should be proceeded with separately. This may kindly be borne in mind while regulating cases under paragraphs 2 and 3 above. Wherever interest becomes payable in terms of these orders, the same shall be allowed upto the end of the months preceding the month in which gratuity/arrears of gratuity is paid.\\n\\n5. These orders shall take effect from the date of issue of this O.M. The cases of those government servants who retired/died while in service before this date would also be covered if gratuity has not been paid as on the date of issue of this Office Memorandum and there has been delay in its payment beyond three months/six months, as the case may be, of the date of their retirement/death but the interest would be payable in such cases only from the date of the issue of this OM or three months/six months, as the case may be, from the date of retirement/ death,whichever date is later. Past cases of retirement otherwise than on superannuation on and on death already settled before the issue of this OM, however, need not be reopened. Pg-44 Back\\n\\n6.

It has since been brought to the notice of this Department that the concerned administrative authorities as indicated in First Schedule to the said rules including authorities subordinate to the leave sanctioning authorities to whom such powers have been delegated, are not ensuring that the dues, as admissible to a Government servant retiring on attaining the age of superannuation, are promptly paid. This has led to avoidable litigation where courts have been directing payment of interest on such delayed payments. It has been observed from the references received in this Department that the delays in such payments are predominantly due to avoidable administrative reasons relating to processing of such cases.\\n\\n3. It is further stated that the Leave Account of a Government servant is a dynamic document which is required to be revisited periodically to record credits of Earned Leave and Half Pay Leave in terms of provisions of rules 26 and 29 of the CCS(Leave) Rules, 1972 with entries made on each occasion the Government servant avails the leave of the kind due and admissible to him. Further, the said rules envisage that advance credits be made in the leave account of the Government servant and a constant check maintained to ensure that the total accumulations at any given time do not exceed 300 +IS days.\\n\\n4. Delays in reckoning the leave accumulations at the credit of Government servant at any stage, particularly at the time of his retirement on superannuation, cannot be acceptable and can be construed as administrative lapse, liable to attract provisions of the CCS(Conduct) Ru1eS, 1964 and CCS(CCA) Rules, 1965. All cases of delay may be looked into and delays in disbursement of dues to Government servants retiring on attaining the age of superannuation be avoided.\\n\\nPg-126\\n\\nBack\\n\\n5. The administrative authorities may consider putting in place a mechanism to check such delays and define various processing parameters and time lines viz. issuance of orders in respect of such retiring Government servants who have 300+15 days earned leave at their credit on the 20\" of the month in which they are retiring as any leave availed by such Government servants shall not impact the maximum ceiling of encashment of such leave even if any request is made for grant of earned leave during the said period. The possibility ofe-transfer of dues can also be worked out in consultation with respective P&AOs.\\n\\n6. All Ministries/Departments are accordingly advised to bring the position referred to in this OM to the notice of all concerned from the perspective of ensuring that the dues of leave encashment in respect of Government servants retiring on attaining the age of superannuation are discharged with due promptness. It maybe ensured that sanction orders, in this regard are issued timely, so that dues admissible to the Government servants on attaining the age of superannuation, on account of encashment of leave, are discharged as soon as possible, preferably on the next working day following the date of their retirement on superannuation.

In these cases it was observed that the GPF account is maintained by an establishment different from that generating their salary bills and deducting their GPF subscription. Needless to say that a co-ordination mechanism between such two establishments is most crucial to avoid any lapses in updated maintenance of GPF accounts.\\n\\n2. been decided that, i.\\n\\nIn order to avoid such grievances and for the sake of greater transparency, it has henceforth\\n\\nii.\\n\\nit shall be mandatory for all of�ices maintaining GPF Accounts to intimate the particulars of missing credits, once every �inancial year, to the authority responsible for deducting the GPF subscription, under intimation to the concerned subscriber.

Similar reasons or received\\n\\n3. From the representations of the Government employees and the references received from Ministries/Departments, it has been observed that in many of the cases referred to this Department, selection process (including written examination, interview and declaration of result) for recruitment had been completed before 01.01.2004 but the employee joined the Government service on or after 01.01.2004. A few illustrations where the selection was finalized before 01.01.2004 but actual joining took place on or after 01.01.2004 are as under: The result for recruitment was declared before 01.01.2004 but the offer of appointment and (i) actual joining of the Government servant was delayed on account of police verification, medical examination etc.;\\n\\n(ii) Some of the candidates selected through a common selection process were issued offers of appointments and were also appointed before 01.01.2004 whereas the offers of appointment to to administrative other selected candidates were reasons/constraints including pending Court/CAT cases.\\n\\nissued on or after 1.1.2004 due\\n\\n151\\n\\nBack\\n\\n(iii) Candidates selected before 01.01.2004 through a common competitive examination were allocated to different Departments/organization.

In order to get information of the BSR code, sometimes a retiree has to make multiple visits to the concerned bank branch.\\n\\n2.

A Government servant may find difficulty in submission of his pension Forms (Form 5, Form 3, etc.) to the Head of Office (HOO) or the Head of Office (HOO) may not be able to forward the claim form in hard copy along with service book to the concerned Pay & Accounts office in time, particularly when both the offices are located in different cities. There may also be cases where the Pay & Accounts Office is not able to process the case for authorization of pension before the retirement of the Government servant.\\n\\n2. Rule 64 of the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972 provides for sanction of provisional pension and provisional gratuity in cases where a Government servant is likely to retire before finalization of his pension and gratuity. In order to ensure timely payment of pension and retirement gratuity on retirement of a Government servant, wherever a Government servant is likely to retire before finalization of his pensionary benefits, the Head of Office may rely upon the information as available in the official records and take action to sanction provisional pension and provisional gratuity, with the approval of the Head of Department. The provisional pension and provisional gratuity may be sanctioned in those cases also, where retiring Government servant is unable to submit the pension claim Forms for any reason. In cases where it is not possible to verify the entire length of qualifying service immediately, provisional gratuity may be sanctioned in respect of the verified continuous spell of service immediately preceding the date of retirement. A copy of the draft letter for sanction of provisional pension is being enclosed.

A doubt has been raised whether the provision of the aforesaid OM, dated 10.12.2010, would be applicable to the Government servants who were boarded out of service, prior to 01.01.2006, with a qualifying service of less than ten years.\\n\\n3. The matter has been examined and it is clarified that Central Civil Government servants who were boarded out, prior to 01.01.2006, with a qualifying service of less than ten years and were in receipt of only the disability element of disability pension, would also be eligible for the service element of disability pension, w.e.f. 01.01.2006, in addition to the disability element.\\n\\n4. For calculating the disability pension w.e.f. 01.01.2006, the disability pension comprising, both the service element and the disability element, will be notionally fixed from the date of boarding out and the same will be notionally revised in accordance with the orders for revision of disability pension, issued from time to time. The actual payment of such revised disability pension would be payable only w.e.f. 01.01.2006. No arrears on account of grant of service element, for the period prior to 01.01.2006, would be admissible. The amount of service gratuity, if any paid, to the Government servant at the time of boarding out would be adjusted from the arrears of pension accruing as a result of these orders. 5.

It has been brought to the notice of this Department that the process of forwarding the family pension case to Pay & Accounts Office along with requisite documents itself takes a long time. It is also understood that, in a large number of cases, provisional family pension and gratuity are not being sanctioned on death of a Government servant. The delay in finalization of family pension and gratuity results in hardship to the family of the deceased Government servant.\\n\\n2. The matter has been examined in this Department. In accordance with Rule 54 (2) (ii) of the CCS (Pension) Rules, on death of Government servant during service, the family of a deceased Government Servant becomes entitled to family pension even in cases where a government servant dies before completion of one year of continuous service, provided the deceased government servant concerned, immediately prior to his/ her appointment to the service or post, was examined by appropriate medical authority and declared fit by that authority. Thus family pension is payable to the family of deceased Government servant irrespective of the length of service of the Government servant before his death. Therefore, verification of the entire service is not relevant for determining the amount of family pension. The amount of death gratuity, however, depends on the length of qualifying service of the deceased Government servant. Any Government dues in respect of the deceased Government servant are also required to be recovered from the amount of death gratuity.\\n\\n3. Keeping in view the position mentioned in para 2 above and in order to avoid any hardship to the family of the deceased Government servant, it has been decided to relax the provisions of rule 80-A of the CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972 to the extent that if a claim for family pension in Form 14 along with death certificate and bank account details of the claimant has been received and the Head of Office is satisfied about the bonafide of that claim, he shall sanction provisional family pension immediately. The Head of Office shall not wait for forwarding of the family pension case (including Form-14, Form-18 and other relevant documents mentioned in Rule 80) to Pay & Accounts Office before sanctioning the provisional family pension. The amount of provisional family pension shall not exceed the maximum family pension\\n\\n4. as admissible under Rule 54 of CCS Pension Rules, 1972.\\n\\n5. In Central Armed Police Forces related cases, where death of an employee occurs, initially provisional family pension may be sanctioned without waiting for the final Operation\\n\\n182\\n\\nBack\\n\\nCasualty Report. The Pay & Accounts Office shall release the provisional family pension on the basis of 6. sanction order issued by the Head of Office without insisting for any other documents including service book. The provisional family pension shall be paid in the same manner as Pay and Allowances of the establishment are paid.\\n\\n7. enclosed.\\n\\nA format for sanctioning the provisional family pension by the Head of Department is\\n\\nThere will be no change in regard to the provisions for sanction of provisional gratuity 8. under Rule 80-A. Action for sanction of death gratuity under rule 80-A may be taken by the Head of Office after forwarding Form-18 and other relevant documents to Pay & Accounts Office. In case the amount of provisional family pension is later found to be in excess of the final family pension, the same may be adjusted from the amount of death gratuity, failing which, it may be recovered in installments from the family pension payable in future.\\n\\n9. The payment of provisional family pension sanctioned as per Para 3 above may initially continue for a period of six months from the date, following the date of death of employee. The period of such provisional family pension sanctioned may be further extended, for not more than six months at a time, on the advice of Pay & Accounts Office and with the approval of Head of Department (HOD).\\n\\n10. The provisional family pension may continue to be paid for two months succeeding the month in which the Pension Payment Order for final family pension is issued by the Pay & Accounts Office, keeping in view the time likely to be taken by Central Pension Accounting Office (CPAO) and Central Pension Processing Centre (CPPC) for processing the case. While authorizing final family pension after receipt of complete family pension case, the Pay & Account office shall indicate the date from which the family pension authorized in the Pension Payment Order is to be paid by the Pension Disbursing Authority. Accordingly, the Office of Pay & Account may record a note in the Pension Payment Order, as mentioned below, while authorizing the final family pension:\\n\\n“Provisional family pension has been/shall be paid for the period from ------- to --- @ Rs. -------------- plus Dearness Relief.

In the absence of their PPO, these pensioners have to face innumerable hardship at various stages of their retired life. For newly retiring officials, in view of the widespread Covid-19 pandemic, it is a dilemma to physically receive hard copies of the PPO.\\n\\n2. Accordingly, the Department of Pension & Pensioners’ Welfare (DoPPW) has decided to integrate the electronic Pension Payment Order (e-PPO) generated through Public Financial Management System (PFMS) application of CGA(Controller General of Accounts) with Digi Locker, in order to enhance Ease of Living of Central Government Civil Pensioners. This system will enable any Pensioner to obtain an instant copy/print-out of the latest copy of his PPO from his Digi Locker account. This initiative will create a permanent record of his PPO in his Digi Locker and at the same time eliminate delays in reaching the PPO to new pensioners, as well as the necessity of handing over a physical copy.\\n\\n3. This facility has been created within ‘Bhavishya’ software, which is a single window platform for Pensioners, right from the start of their Pension processing, till the end of the process. “Bhavishya” shall now provide an option to the retiring employees, to link their Digi-locker account with their “Bhavishya” account and obtain their e-PPO in a seamless manner.\\n\\n4. The following steps are required to store e-PPO in Digi Locker:\\n\\nBhavishya” provides option to retiring employees for linking their Digi-locker account with “Bhavishya” to get e-PPO.\\n\\nAbove option is available to the retiree at the time of filling of retirement forms, as well as after submission of the forms\\n\\nRetiree will sign into their Digi-locker account from Bhavishya and authorize Bhavishya to PUSH the e-PPO to Digi Locker.\\n\\nAs soon as e-PPO is issued, it is automatically PUSHED into corresponding Digi locker account and the retiree is informed about the same through SMS and Email by Bhavishya.\\n\\n185\\n\\nBack\\n\\nTo view/download the e-PPO, retiree has to log into the Digi Locker account and simply click on the link.\\n\\n5.
